## **1. Core Architecture: A Dual-Ecosystem Approach**

ProfitForge is architected around two distinct, on-chain ecosystems deployed on the Sepolia testnet. This design allows the platform to showcase innovations in both algorithmic DeFi (the AI-AMM) and institutional-grade finance (the Trust Layer).

### **Ecosystem A: The AI-Powered AMM**

This is a functional, self-contained decentralized exchange where market parameters are optimized by a decentralized AI network.

*   **`AdaptiveMarketMaker`**: The core exchange contract. It facilitates swaps and liquidity provisioning. Its key feature is the ability to have its trading fee dynamically adjusted by consuming data from the `AIPredictiveLiquidityOracle`.
*   **`AIPredictiveLiquidityOracle`**: A decentralized oracle network where AI providers stake ETH to submit predictions on optimal trading fees and market volatility. It uses a consensus mechanism to validate data and a reward/slashing system to ensure accuracy. This contract makes AI actions verifiable and transparent on-chain.
*   **`AdvancedPriceOracle`**: A robust price oracle that aggregates multiple feeds to provide a secure, manipulation-resistant price for assets, crucial for accurate calculations within the AMM and treasury.

**➡️ Live Interaction**: The [AMM Demo Page](/amm-demo) provides a full-featured UI to interact with this ecosystem, including creating pools, adding/removing liquidity, swapping tokens, and simulating AI data submission.

### **Ecosystem B: The Trust Layer for RWAs**

This ecosystem provides a secure and transparent framework for tokenizing and managing real-world assets and governing a protocol.

*   **`MainContract`**: The ecosystem's controller and security anchor. It manages authorizations for all other contracts, governs the protocol-wide treasury, and includes an emergency pause function. No contract can operate within the Trust Layer without its explicit approval.
*   **`ProofBond`**: An ERC721 contract for creating tokenized, yield-bearing bonds. Each bond is a unique NFT containing immutable on-chain data about its principal, yield, maturity, and collateral. This contract serves as a blueprint for institutional-grade RWA tokenization.
*   **`OpenGovernor`**: A standard DAO governance contract that allows token holders to vote on binding proposals, such as changing the `protocolFeeRate` in the `MainContract` or authorizing a new strategy for the `SafeVault`.
*   **`SafeVault`**: An autonomous treasury that collects fees generated by the protocol. It is designed to programmatically deploy these funds into a whitelist of approved, low-risk yield-generating strategies, creating a self-sustaining economic model.

**➡️ Live Interaction**: The [Trust Layer Page](/), the application's home page, serves as a dashboard for this ecosystem, displaying real-time data from these contracts.
