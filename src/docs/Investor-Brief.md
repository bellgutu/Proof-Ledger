### **1. Executive Summary**

**EnterpriseVerifi** is a closed-loop verification system for global supply chains. We provide businesses with a single, unified platform to verify shipping, insurance, and quality control, replacing fragmented, manual, and fraud-prone processes.

By leveraging real-time data integrations and providing immutable audit trails, EnterpriseVerifi drastically reduces operational costs, mitigates supply chain risks, and unlocks new efficiencies.

### **2. The Problem: The High Cost of Mistrust**

Global supply chains run on a complex web of paper documents, siloed systems, and manual checks. This creates massive inefficiencies and risks:

*   **High Verification Costs**: Businesses spend up to 15% of a shipment's value on manual document verification, inspections, and insurance checks.
*   **Fraud & Disputes**: Forged documents, counterfeit goods, and quality disputes cost global businesses billions annually.
*   **Lack of Visibility**: Poor visibility into shipment status, quality, and compliance leads to costly delays and broken supply chains.

EnterpriseVerifi is an all-in-one platform built on three core modules:

*   **1. Shipping & Logistics Verification**: Real-time verification of shipping milestones (FOB, CIF), customs documentation, and live shipment tracking through API and IoT integrations.
*   **2. Insurance & Finance Integration**: Automated validation of cargo and title insurance policies, streamlined claims processing, and a foundation for supply chain financing against verified assets.
*   **3. Quality & Compliance Verification**: Digital verification of quality certifications (e.g., GIA, organic), inspection reports, and regulatory compliance, ensuring assets meet required standards.
